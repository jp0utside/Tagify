## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk: Spotify API Rate Limits**
- **Mitigation:** Implement request queuing and batching
- **Monitoring:** Track API usage and implement exponential backoff
- **Fallback:** Queue operations for later when limits hit

**Risk: Sync Conflicts**
- **Mitigation:** Spotify as source of truth, clear conflict resolution
- **Monitoring:** Log sync conflicts and user notifications
- **Fallback:** Manual sync option with conflict resolution UI

**Risk: Performance with Large Libraries**
- **Mitigation:** Optimize SQLite queries, use indexes, implement pagination
- **Monitoring:** Performance testing with 10k+ songs
- **Fallback:** Progressive loading and result limiting

**Risk: Network Connectivity Issues**
- **Mitigation:** Offline state detection, queue operations for later
- **Monitoring:** Connectivity status indicators
- **Fallback:** Local-only mode with sync when connected

### Product Risks

**Risk: Spotify API Changes**
- **Mitigation:** Stay updated with Spotify developer community
- **Monitoring:** Automated API health checks
- **Fallback:** Export functionality to preserve user data

**Risk: User Adoption**
- **Mitigation:** Start with personal use, validate concept
- **Monitoring:** User feedback and usage analytics
- **Fallback:** Iterate based on real usage patterns
