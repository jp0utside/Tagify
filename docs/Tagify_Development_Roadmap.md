- SQLite database with optimized schema
- Core services and data models implemented
- Basic UI navigation and screens ready

**✅ Phase 2 Complete (Week 2): Library Import & Data Management**
- ImportService with paginated Spotify fetch, progress tracking, cancellation
- TagService with full CRUD (create/rename/delete) and Spotify playlist sync
- Import screen with progress UI and error/cancel/completion states
- Library screen with album art, search, pull-to-refresh
- Tags screen with Tags/Playlists tabs, overflow menu (rename/delete)
- Proper provider wiring for all services
- Web deployment via GitHub Actions → GitHub Pages
- Fixed Spotify OAuth PKCE (SHA256) and same-tab redirect for web
- Unit tests for ImportService (8) and TagService (17)

**🚧 Next: Phase 3 (Week 3): Tagging System**

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk: Spotify API Rate Limits**
- **Mitigation:** Implement request queuing and batching
- **Monitoring:** Track API usage and implement exponential backoff
- **Fallback:** Queue operations for later when limits hit

**Risk: Sync Conflicts**
- **Mitigation:** Spotify as source of truth, clear conflict resolution
- **Monitoring:** Log sync conflicts and user notifications
- **Fallback:** Manual sync option with conflict resolution UI

**Risk: Performance with Large Libraries**
- **Mitigation:** Optimize SQLite queries, use indexes, implement pagination
- **Monitoring:** Performance testing with 10k+ songs
- **Fallback:** Progressive loading and result limiting

**Risk: Network Connectivity Issues**
- **Mitigation:** Offline state detection, queue operations for later
- **Monitoring:** Connectivity status indicators
- **Fallback:** Local-only mode with sync when connected

### Product Risks

**Risk: Spotify API Changes**
- **Mitigation:** Stay updated with Spotify developer community
- **Monitoring:** Automated API health checks
- **Fallback:** Export functionality to preserve user data

**Risk: User Adoption**
- **Mitigation:** Start with personal use, validate concept
- **Monitoring:** User feedback and usage analytics
- **Fallback:** Iterate based on real usage patterns
